# MediaHotkeys

This is to enable media control hotkeys with a keyboard that doesn't have them.
Implemented using AutoIt 3

I threw this together really quickly. Feature requests, etc, welcome.

I intend to make this customizable.

In theory, you can download and run the .exe without installing AutoIt

The current hotkeys are

Pause/Play:       Win+F8
Mute:             Win+F9
Vol Down:         Win+F10
Vol Up:           Win+F11
Exit/End Script:  Win+Esc

If you don't have FnLock on, make sure you also hold Fn.

The Pause might only work on some things - Firefox isn't letting it work in YouTube. I think there are browser settings about allowing hardware media controls.
